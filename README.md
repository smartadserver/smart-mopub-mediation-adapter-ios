Smart AdServer - MoPub SDK Adapter for iOS
==============================================

Introduction
------------
The **_Smart AdServer iOS SDK_** can be used with **_MoPub SDK_** through Custom Event Classes provided in this repository.
Supported Ad Formats are _Banners_, _Fullscreen_, _Rewarded Video_ and _Native Ads_.

Setup
-----

1) Install the **_Smart AdServer iOS SDK_** in your XCode Project. This can be done using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/SmartAdServer-DisplaySDK) or by following the instructions in our [documentation](http://help.smartadserver.com/iOS/V6.6/#IntegrationGuides/Installation.htm%3FTocPath%3DGetting%20started%7C_____1).


2) Checkout this repository and copy the **Custom Event Classes** you need into your XCode Project.
  * _`SASMopubBannerCustomEvent`_ for banner ads.
  * _`SASMopubInterstitialCustomEvent`_ for interstitial ads.
  * _`SASMopubRewardedVideoCustomEvent`_ for rewarded videos.
  * _`SASMopubNativeAdAdapter`_ **and** _`SASMopubNativeAdCustomEvent`_ for native ads.
  * _`SASMopubCustomEventConstants.h`_ in any cases.


3) Edit the _`SASMopubCustomEventConstants`_ header and replace the **`kSASMopubBaseURLString`** with your dedicated baseURL.


4) _(Optional)_ **If you plan to use Native Ads, don't forget to add _`SASMopubNativeAdCustomEvent`_ as a _supportedCustomEvent_ to your _`MPNativeAdRendererConfiguration`_ or its subclass.**
  ```
  MPNativeAdRendererConfiguration *config = [MPStaticNativeAdRenderer rendererConfigurationWithRendererSettings:settings];
  config.supportedCustomEvents =  @[@"SASMopubNativeAdCustomEvent"];
  ```


5) On your MoPub's dashboard, create a new ***Custom Native Network*** under the _Networks_ tab, and fill your Ad Units with the relevant Custom Event Classes. _For example for a banner Ad Unit, set `SASMopubBannerCustomEvent` as the **Custom Event Class**_.


6) Fill the _**Custom Event Class Data**_ with the informations of your _Smart AdServer's_ placements. You must use a valid JSON String and the 4 parameters : **siteid**, **pageid**, **formatid** and **target** must exist in this string. If you want to leave a parameter empty (_target for instance_) feel free to do it, as long as **all keys exist**.
  ```
  {"siteid":"your-siteID","pageid":"your-pageID","formatid":"your-formatID","target":"your-target-or-empty"}
  ```


7) Make sure your new _Custom Native Network_ is activated for your chosen Ad Units and Segments.


8) That's it, you're all set, you should be able to display _Smart AdServer's_ ads through your _MoPub SDK_ integration.


Known limitations
----------
- **Impressions** : due to a different logic in impression counting, you may experience discrepancies between MoPub and Smart AdServer impression statistics for Interstitial and RewardedVideo placements. MoPub will count impressions only when the ad is shown whereas Smart AdServer will count as soon as the ad is fully loaded even if you never display it. 
- **Clicks** : you may experience discrepancies between MoPub and Smart AdServer click statistics. This is due to the fact that MoPub can only count one click per ad whereas Smart AdServer is able to count multiple clicks on the same ad.
